About
---------

Eire guess is a windows application I made for Windows tablet, pc and phone. I created as a college project (2nd year) and also as an entry in the GMIT Hackathon 2013 & Windows App Hero competitions. 

Once you start the game you are presented with an image of Ireland, a county name and a count down timer. You must tap on the correct county before the timer runs out in order to get a point. When you tap the screen the correct county is highlighted. It's great for people who want to learn the Irish counties, children love it. 

You get one point for each correct answer, each county comes up once randomely, once the game is over your name is saved on the scoreboard. You can edit your name in the settings, you can also turn the timer off. 

Tools used
---------

I used C#, XAML in Visual Studio, and Microsoft Blend (Image Mapping) and other utilities such as GIMP (image editing) in order to create the app.
